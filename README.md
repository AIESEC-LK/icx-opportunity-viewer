## Issues

- GEP Opportunities were not included as the Staging API did not contain a lot of them and paging mechanism for GEP Opportunities were confusing to implement.
- Units Tests were not implemented.
- Filter mechanisms for other filters were not included as staging API do not have consistent data (Validating null values for a large amount of data is a bit of a pain)
